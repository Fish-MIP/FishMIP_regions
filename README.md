# FishMIP_regional models
This repository includes the creation of a single shapefile containing all FishMIP regional models.

If you are interested in submitting your regional model to the FishMIP group, please contact our **Regional Model Coordinators**. You can find their contact details in our [website](https://fish-mip.github.io/).  
  
A copy of shapefile including all FishMIP regional model boundaries can be found in the [FishMIP THREDDS server](http://portal.sf.utas.edu.au/thredds/catalog/gem/fishmip/FishMIP_regions/catalog.html).
